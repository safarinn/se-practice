# Lab report — Practice #02: The Prompt Is an Engineering Input

**Name:**
**Group:**
**Date:**

> Fill in every section. **Do not delete or renumber the headings** — the grading pass reads them
> by number. If something did not happen, write "did not happen" and why; an empty section and a
> fabricated one are graded the same way.

## 1. The frozen experiment

| --- | --- |
| AI assistant |Claude |
| Exact model name |Claude Opus 4.8 |
| Implementation language | Python|
| Date of the runs | 20.09.2026|

**Non-Python students only** — paste your substituted Prompt B text here, so the substitution can
be checked:

```
(paste here, or write "n/a — used Python")
```

**Confirmations:**

- Each prompt was sent in a **fresh chat**: yes 
- No follow-up questions were asked before Part 7: yes 
- Every output was saved **before** any editing: yes

## 2. Prompt A — minimal

**Prompt sent** (should be exactly one sentence):

```
Write Python code to analyze student marks.
```

**Assumptions the AI made that I never gave it** — list them, one per line. A data format, a pass
threshold, a rounding rule, an input method, an invented feature all count.

1.Data format — used a hardcoded Python dictionary of name→mark instead of a file, list, or user input
2.Marks are integers on a 0–100 scale
3.Grade thresholds (A≥90, B≥80, C≥70, D≥60, F below) were invented; no grading scheme was given

**Questions it should have asked and did not:**

1.What input format and source should be used (file, list, dict etc), and does each student have one mark or several subjects?
2.What is the required grading scheme or pass threshold and rounding rule, and should results be printed or returned?

**Is the function named `analyze_marks` with the required signature?** yes / no — if no, what is it
called:

no — there is no analyze_marks function at all; the only function is get_grade(mark), and the analysis logic runs at module level

**First impression before testing** (one sentence — you will compare this with section 6 later):

 It looks like a tidy, runnable demo, but it's a self-contained toy script that answers a much narrower, more assumption-laden question than the one-sentence prompt actually asked
---

## 3. Prompt B — structured context

**Prompt sent** (paste it in full, including any substitutions):

```
You are a Python developer. Implement analyze_marks(marks, pass_mark=50).
Return average, highest, lowest, and pass_rate in a dictionary. Accept marks
from 0 to 100; raise ValueError for an empty list, non-numeric values, or
out-of-range values. Use no external libraries. Return code plus a short
explanation

```

**What B fixed compared to A:**

1 Adds input validation for empty lists, non-numeric values, and out-of-range marks
2 Returns the required statistics in a dictionary.


**What B still leaves open:**

1.Whether `pass_rate` should be returned as a fraction or a percentage
2.Whether `pass_mark` should also be restricted to the 0 to 100 range

---

## 4. Prompt C — examples and tests

**What I appended to Prompt B:**

```
Example: analyze_marks([40, 60, 80], 50) → average 60, highest 80, lowest 40,
pass_rate 66.67. Include tests for: one mark, decimals, custom pass_mark, empty list,
text value, and marks below 0 or above 100. State any remaining assumptions before
the code.
```

**Tests the AI wrote for itself** — how many, and which situations do they cover?

| Situation | Covered by the AI's tests? |
| --- | --- |
| one mark | |
| decimals | |
| custom pass_mark | |
| empty list | |
| text value | |
| below 0 / above 100 | |

**Do the AI's own tests pass against the AI's own code?** yes / no

**Do they agree with the harness in section 6?** yes / no — if no, where do they disagree:

**Assumptions C stated explicitly before the code:**

---

## 5. Prompt D — my combined prompt

**The complete prompt I wrote** (one message, sent to a fresh chat):

```

```

**What I deliberately added that A, B and C did not have:**

1.
2.
3.

**The ambiguity I found in the specification, and how I resolved it inside Prompt D:**

---

## 6. Test results — the evidence

Six cases × four prompts. Verdicts are **PASS**, **FAIL** or **ERROR** only.

| # | Call | Required | A | B | C | D |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `analyze_marks([40, 60, 80], 50)` | avg 60 · high 80 · low 40 · rate 66.67 | | | | |
| 2 | `analyze_marks([100], 50)` | avg 100 · high 100 · low 100 · rate 100 | | | | |
| 3 | `analyze_marks([49.5, 50], 50)` | avg 49.75 · high 50 · low 49.5 · rate 50 | | | | |
| 4 | `analyze_marks([], 50)` | raises ValueError | | | | |
| 5 | `analyze_marks([40, "60"], 50)` | raises ValueError | | | | |
| 6 | `analyze_marks([-1, 50, 101], 50)` | raises ValueError | | | | |
| | **Totals** | | /6 | /6 | /6 | /6 |

**For every FAIL and ERROR above, one line: what was returned or raised instead.**

| Prompt | Case | What actually happened |
| --- | --- | --- |
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |

### Pasted terminal output — all four runs

**Prompt B**

**Prompt C**

**Prompt D**

## 7. Scoring

0–2 per criterion, using the rubric in `README.md` Part 7.

| Criterion | A | B | C | D |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Correctness (cases passed) | | | | |
| Requirement coverage | | | | |
| Verifiability (tests) | | | | |
| Assumptions stated | | | | |
| Noise (2 = none) | | | | |
| **Total / 10** | | | | |

**Prompt length, in words:** A ____ · B ____ · C ____ · D ____

**Words added per point gained** — B over A, C over B, D over C. One line on what that ratio says:

## 8. Conclusion — 150–200 words

Answer in this order: (1) which prompt scored best, and whether it is the one you would actually
use at work; (2) which single addition bought the most correctness, naming the exact case that
changed verdict; (3) what was pure noise; (4) the ambiguity and your resolution.

Name test cases and real returned values. "More detailed prompts work better" scores zero.
